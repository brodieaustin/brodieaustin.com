Dilys Rana wrote a book about the history of Welsh settlers in Chicago. In researching her book, she uncovered many documents that detailed who these people were, the organizations they belonged to, and their impact on the city. To support the book and continue the conversation about this untold history, she wanted a dynamic website for all of this content.

The site is built with Craft CMS and is designed to give each thing in the database it's own unique URL. This makes commenting and sharing much easier. There also is a simple contribution form for people to send Dilys information about their families or other research they've done.

Amita liked the work that I had done on my own personal portfolio site and reached out for help. She wanted a simple way to display her work, including her publications and presentations. She also wanted an easy way to share snippets of articles and thoughts.

We used [Pantone's 2016 spring color palette](http://www.pantone.com/pages/fcr/?season=spring&year=2016&pid=11) for the site and [Monserrat](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat) from Google Fonts, a close approximation of Gotham. Craft CMS powers the backend. It's become my go to CMS for freelance projects and worked perfectly for this one.

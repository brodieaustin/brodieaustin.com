Lauren, the founder and conductor for the Youth Chorus of the North Shore, wanted to pivot her organization. To go along with this, she reached out to me to help redesign her website and create a clean, modern website with more of an upscale feel. We used Craft CMS to build the site. To give the site a more sophisticated look, I choose [Gentium Basic](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Gentium+Basic) for the body font and [Work Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Work+Sans) for the header font.

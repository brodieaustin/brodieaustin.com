The Buddy Foundation is an completely volunteer-run animal shelter located in Arlington Heights, Illinois. They needed a modern website that would be easy for multiple volunteers to manage. Based on their feedback and user interviews that I conducted, we focused the site on the wonderful animals that they shelter--for life if necessary. They also wanted to highlight their events and various fundraising initiatives like memberships.

In addition to designing and building the site, I conducted user interviews for this project, did on-site usability testing with their volunteers and clients, and conducted training.

Like many of my freelance projects, we used Craft CMS to build the site. Thus far, the various volunteers have found the site easy to update and maintain.

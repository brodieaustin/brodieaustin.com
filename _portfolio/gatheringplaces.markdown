A former colleague, now a professor and researcher at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, reached out to me about customizing the look and feel of an Omeka site he started building with students in a public history course. The site catalogs the religious history of Milwaukee in the built environment, relying heavily of maps, images, and sounds.

[Omeka](https://omeka.org/) bills itself as the "Wordpress" for online collections and exhibits. It is frequently used by libraries, musuems, and humanists to mount projects like this one.

The project evolved into a complete custom theme for the site. The theme is licensed under the GPL 3.0 open source license and is available to browse (and download) on [Github](https://github.com/GatheringPlaces/gatheringplaces-theme).

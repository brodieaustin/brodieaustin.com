Hi, my name is Brodie. I have been building website and doing user experience (UX) research since 2011. In addition to building website, I am a library and write about some of [various library projects](/blog/) here as well.

Get in touch with me if you're need a new website, particularly if you're a non-profit, a small business owner, or just have an interesting idea.
